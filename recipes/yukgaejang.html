        <h2>A perfect soup for cold days</h2>
        <p>Yukgaejang, also known as spicy beef soup, is a spicy, soup-like Korean dish made from shredded</p>
        <p>with scallions and other ingredients, which are simmered together for a long time. It is a</p>
        <p>variety of gomguk, or thick soup, which was formerly served in Korean royal court cuisine.</p>
        <p>It is thought to be healthful and is popular due to its hot and spicy nature.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound beef brisket, cut into several pieces along the grain 3 inch long, soaked in cold water for 10 to 20 minutes, washed, and drained</li>
            <li>4 dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, cut in half</li>
            <li>12 ounces mung bean sprouts, washed and strained</li>
            <li>3-4 large green onions (dae-pa) or 14-16 green onions, cut into 2½ inch long pieces</li>
            <li>6 ounces of soaked (or fresh) gosari (about 2 cups), cut into 2½ inch long pieces</li>
            <li>8 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup Korean hot pepper flakes (gochugaru)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 table spoon toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil (or any cooking oil)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, bring 3 quarts (12 cups) of water to a boil. Add the beef along with the dried shiitake mushrooms and the onion.</li>
            <li>Cook for 1 hour over medium high heat.</li>
            <li>While the pot boils, combine the sauce ingredients in a bowl and mix it well.</li>
            <li>Cover with plastic wrap and set aside.</li>
            <li>Put the mung bean sprouts, green onions, gosari, and garlic in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>1 hour later, check the beef. Take a sample chunk and split it with your fingers or fork. If it splits nicely, it’s done. If it’s a little tough to split, let it cook for 10 more minutes. As stock boils off, you want to maintain about 10 cups’ worth, so add some water.</li>
            <li>When it’s done, remove the beef, onion, and mushrooms with a slotted strainer.</li>
            <li>Let the beef and mushrooms cool down and discard the cooked onion.</li>
            <li>Mix the vegetables with the seasoning sauce by hand until well incorporated. Add to the boiling stock.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook 20 minutes over medium high heat until the vegetables are cooked through and tender, but not mushy.</li>
            <li>Slice the mushrooms and pull the beef apart into strips. Add to the boiling soup and cook another 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat, ladle and serve. Prepare a small bowl of salt on the table, for anyone who wants to add some. Serve with rice and side dishes. Before eating, people can add a pinch of salt to their taste if they like.</li>
        </ol>
