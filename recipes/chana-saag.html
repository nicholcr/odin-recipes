        <h2>Favorite Indian Dish</h2>
        <p>In India, it is common, especially in the state of Odisha, where it is eaten with</p>
        <p>pakhala. In the Shree Jagannath Temple of Puri, saag is one of the dishes offered to Jagannath</p>
        <p>as part of Mahaprasad. Saag is also common in West Bengal and other regions of North India, where</p>
        <p>the most common preparation is saron da saag (mustard plant leaves), which may be eaten with makki di roti,</p>
        <p>a yellow roti made with maize flour.[3] Saag gosht or hariyali maans (spinach and mutton) is a common dish</p>
        <p>in the North Indian state of Punjab.[4] In Pakistan, it is most commonly eaten in the Punjab province along</p>
        <p>with Makki di roti, made from freshly ground corn flour, and fresh buffalo or cow butter or ghee.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup dry chickpeas</li>
            <li>4-5 cups leafy greens *</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>½ cup mint (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp avocado oil or another neutral oil</li>
            <li>½ tsp cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1 inch ginger, minced</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>2 green chilis, minced</li>
            <li>½ red onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tomato, diced</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>½ tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>½ tsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>¼ tsp red chili powder</li>
            <li>½ tsp amchur (dried mango powder)</li>
            <li>½ tsp garam masala</li>
            <li>1 tsp kasoori methi (dried fenugreek leaves)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare your dry chickpeas (or use 2 cans, for a total of 3 cups of chickpeas). In an Instant Pot: if using unsoaked chickpeas, pressure cook with 3 cups water + 1 tsp salt for 60 minutes at high pressure. If using soaked chickpeas, pressure cook with 3 cups water + 1 tsp salt for 15 minutes at high pressure.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle for 30 seconds or so before adding ginger, garlic, and green chilis. Stir frequently for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add onion and cook until translucent. Add tomato and a big pinch of salt. Let the tomato juices evaporate a little, until the tomatoes are mushy. Then add the ground spices and gently stir them with everything else.</li>
            <li>Add all the greens and 1 cup water. Cover and cook over medium-low until the greens are soft.</li>
            <li>Let the pan cool off a bit before blending its contents with of cilantro. I blended on medium speed so it was creamy but not too creamy.</li>
            <li>Add the green gravy back to the pan, using 1 cup of water to clean out the blender. Simmer over medium-low, allowing excess water to evaporate until it is at a texture you like.</li>
            <li>Finish with garam masala, crushed kasoori methi, and salt to taste. Stir in the chickpeas. Enjoy with rice or roti!</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Notes</h4>
